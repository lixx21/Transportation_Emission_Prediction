# Transportation_Emission_Prediction

# Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era, emission is the most important thing that we must concern. With high emission there is a lot impact that we can feel, there are air pollution, climate change, etc. if emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate, leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans.as emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate, leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans [Climate Change Indicator](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/greenhouse-gases). and this is can be a big problem for us as a human.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of factors that can produced a lot of emissions is transportation, therefore this notebook wants to predict emission from transportation to help reduce high emission vehicle.
